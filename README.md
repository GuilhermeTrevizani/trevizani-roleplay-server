# Trevizani Roleplay

Text-based roleplay game mode for RAGE MP.

The source code has some things in Portuguese and I intend to globalize it soon.

To use the gamemode you also need to use the [UCP](https://github.com/GuilhermeTrevizani/trevizani-roleplay-ucp) and the [client-side](https://github.com/GuilhermeTrevizani/trevizani-roleplay-client).

I'll soon update the documentation with the configuration steps. But you can find out and configure it by reading and understanding the source code.
